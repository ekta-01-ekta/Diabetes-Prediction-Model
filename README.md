# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
The aim of this project is to design and implement
Diabetes Prediction using machine learning methods and
performance analysis of those methods.

● The techniques that I used is support vector machine.

● Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted
earlier.Machine learning techniques will provide better
result for prediction by constructing models from datasets
collected from patients.

# Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning
algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However,
primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that
can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new
data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called
a hyperplane

# Analysing Dataset
The dataset consists of 768 samples. The dataset has total 9 attributes
Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin thickness, Insulin, BMI,
Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age, Outcome out of which 8 are
independent variables and one is the dependent variable i.e. target
variable (outcome) which determines whether patient is having diabetes
or not.

# Data Splitting
Data is divided into training and testing data into 80:20 ratio. Eighty
percent was training data and twenty percent was testing data. Out of
768 records, 614 records were used for trained and 154 records were
used for testing.

# Conclusion
As we are doing classification of diabetic and non
diabetic patients. SVM works relatively well when
there is a clear margin of separation between
classes.SVM is more effective in high dimensional
spaces. SVM is effective in cases where the
number of dimensions is greater than the number
of samples and at the last it is relatively memory
efficient.
