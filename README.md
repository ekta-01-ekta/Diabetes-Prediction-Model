# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
The aim of this project is to design and implement
Diabetes Prediction using machine learning methods and
performance analysis of those methods.

● The techniques that I used is support vector machine.

● Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted
earlier.Machine learning techniques will provide better
result for prediction by constructing models from datasets
collected from patients.
